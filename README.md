# Hello and Welcome to My Github Repo
- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jitendra-Dash , I am a Data Scientist
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning and data science stuff 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data science
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate machine learning and data science work
- 📫 How to reach me you can email at jdash862@gmail.com

Projects That I have done :-
**1. [Network Intrusion Detection System](https://github.com/Jitendra-Dash/Network-Intrusion-detection-system)**
[Detailed Medium Blog](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/network-intrusion-detection-system-4bab3e5baccb)

The intrusion detector learning task is to build a predictive model (i.e. a classifier) capable of distinguishing between bad connections, called intrusions or attacks, and good normal connections.

#### This is an end to end Case study , where you will find   
 - A detailed Exploratory Data Analysis
 - Machine learning Model like (Naive Bayes , Logistic Regression , Randomforest , Decision Tree ,Xgboost)
 - Feature engineering and many more things
