# Hello and Welcome to My Github Repo
- 👋 Hi, My name @Jitendra-Dash , I am a Data Scientist
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning and data science stuff 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data science
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate machine learning and data science work
- 📫 How to reach me you can email at jdash862@gmail.com

Projects That I have done :-  

## **1. [Network Intrusion Detection System](https://github.com/Jitendra-Dash/Network-Intrusion-detection-system)**
[A detailed Explaination about this Case Study (A medium Blog on analytics vidhya Page)](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/network-intrusion-detection-system-4bab3e5baccb) 

The intrusion detector learning task is to build a predictive model (i.e. a classifier) capable of distinguishing between bad connections, called intrusions or attacks, and good normal connections.

#### This is an end to end Case study , where you will find   
 - A detailed Exploratory Data Analysis
 - Machine learning Model like (Naive Bayes , Logistic Regression , Randomforest , Decision Tree ,Xgboost)
 - Feature engineering and many more things

## **2 . [Tweet Sentiment Extraction](https://github.com/Jitendra-Dash/Extracting-Phrase-From-Sentence)**  
[A detailed Explaination about this Case Study (A medium Blog on analytics vidhya Page)](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/extract-the-right-phrase-from-sentence-29aa5f8b9182)  
This case study is about capturing the sentiment or meaning behind a tweet .  
With all of the tweets circulating every second it is hard to tell whether the sentiment behind a specific tweet will impact a company, or a person’s, brand for being viral (positive), or devastate profit because it strikes a negative tone. Capturing sentiment in language is important in these times where decisions and reactions are created and updated in seconds. But, which words actually lead to the sentiment description.

### In This Case Study , i have done
- A detailed EDA
- Deep Learning Algorithm Like : LSTM , Attention ,BERT
- Post Analysis of the Result (here we will see where our prediction making mistake or where it giving us great prediction)
